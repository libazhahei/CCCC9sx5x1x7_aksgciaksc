# Turtle Segmentation Project

This project focuses on the segmentation of turtles using deep learning models. It provides scripts for training, predicting, and visualizing segmentation results. The supported models include U-Net, DeepLabV3, and Mask R-CNN, among others. The project is structured to facilitate easy experimentation and evaluation of different segmentation architectures.
